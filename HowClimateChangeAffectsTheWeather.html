    <h2>How climatechange affects weather</h2>
    <p>Because thereÂ´s already a project from another team with the main topic climate change there will be little information about it. Therefore the main focus in this section will be on the affects on the weather.</p>
    <p>Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.</p>
    <p>Fore example: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>higher temperatures</li>
      <li>heavy precipitation</li>
      <li>more catastrophes such as floods, droughts, etc.</li>
    </ul>
