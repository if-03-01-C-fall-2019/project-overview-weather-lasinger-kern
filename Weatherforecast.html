      <h2>Meteorology</h2>
        <h3>What is meteorology</h3>
          <P>Meteorology is the doctrine of physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere and also includes their most popular application areas:</p>
          <P>Weatherforecasts and climatology</p>
          <p>In addition to atmospheric physics, climate research, and the improvement of weather forecasting methods,
             meteorology also investigates chemical processes</p>
          <p>(eg ozone formation, greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere and observes atmospheric phenomena. </p>
          <p>It is counted among the geosciences and is at universities (see meteorology study) often attached to the institutes
             of geophysics or the respective faculty of physics.</p>

        <h3>Timeline of meteorology</h3>
          <p>Insert cool timeline with some even cooler headlines and links to the articles</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Antiquity</h4>
            <h5>3000 BC </h5>
              <p>In India meteorology can be tracked back to this date with writings such as the "Upanishads",</p>
              <p>containing discussions about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the seasonal cycles caused by the movement of earth round the sun.</p>
            <h5>600 BC </h5>
              <p>Thales, the first greek meteorologist reputedly issues the first seasonal crop forecast. </p>
            <h5>400 BC </h5>
              <p>Hippocrates writes a treatise called Airs, Waters and Places, in which he writes about common diseases that occur in particular locations and seasons. </p>
            <h5>350 BC </h5>
              <p>The Greek philosopher Aristotle writes Meteorology, a work which represents the sum of knowledge of the time about earth sciences, </p>
              <p>including weather and climate. It is the first known work that attempts to treat a broad range of meteorological topics </p>
              <p>For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation falls are called meteors,</p>
              <p>which originate from the Greek word meteoros, meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word comes the modern term meteorology,</p>
              <p>the study of clouds and weather.</p>
              <P>Although the term meteorology is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences,</p>
              <p>Aristotle's work is more general. Meteorologica is based on intuition and simple observation</p>
              <p>but not on what is now considered the scientific method. In his own words: </p>
              <h6></h6>
                <p>...all the affections we may call common to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts.</p>
                <p>The magazine De Mundo (attributed to Pseudo-Aristotle) notes:</p>
                <p>Cloud is a vaporous mass, concentrated and producing water.</p>
                <p>Rain is produced from the compression of a closely condensed cloud, varying according to the pressure exerted on the cloud;</p>
                <p>when the pressure is slight it scatters gentle drops;</p>
                <p>when it is great it produces a more violent fall, and we call this a shower, being heavier than ordinary rain, and forming continuous masses of water falling over earth.</p>
                <p>Snow is produced by the breaking up of condensed clouds, the cleavage taking place before the change into water;</p>
                <p>it is the process of cleavage which causes its resemblance to foam and its intense whiteness,</p>
                <p>while the cause of its coldness is the congelation of the moisture in it before it is dispersed or rarefied.</p>
                <p>When snow is violent and falls heavily we call it a blizzard.</p>
                <p>Hail is produced when snow becomes densified and acquires impetus for a swifter fall from its close mass;</p>
                <p>the weight becomes greater and the fall more violent in proportion to the size of the broken fragments of cloud.</p>
                <p>Such then are the phenomena which occur as the result of moist exhalation.</p>
