        <h2>Weather forecasts and the work of a meteorologist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In this Section will be some information about the work of a meteorologist.</li>
          <li>There will also be content about what meteorology is.</li>
          <li>On our Website will also be an explanation as to why it is very difficult to provide accurat forecasts.</li>

          <li>in this section we will also list up some jobs where it is really important to know how the weather will be in the next few days and will also say why.</li>
          <li>You will also be able to find some information about what things a meteorologist measures.</li>
          <li>We will describe what information is necessary for providing weatherforecasts.</li>
          <li>In this section there will be information from where this data is measured from.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Weather-facts, -records and special weatherphenomena</h2>
        <p>This section will contain a list of some interesting facts and records that have something to do with weather. Of course they will be explained as well.</p>
        <p>For example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest / lowest measured Temprature </li>
            <li>Strongest earthquake </li>

            <li>Most precipitation per m²</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Addetionally there will be information on weather phenomena such as: </p>
        <ul>

      <section>
        <h2>How climatechange affects weather</h2>
        <p>Because there´s already a project from another team with the main topic climate change there will be little information about it. Therefore the main focus in this section will be on the affects on the weather.</p>
        <p>Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.</p>
        <p>Fore example: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>higher temperatures</li>
          <li>heavy precipitation</li>
          <li>more catastrophes such as floods, droughts, etc.</li>
          <li>and so on</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2> Which factors influence the weather</h2>
        <p>In this section will be information on the factors, which influence the weather.</p>
        <p>Fore example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>latitude and altitude</li>
          <li>proximity to the ocean</li>
          <li>mountains</li>
          <li>vegetation</li>
          <li>earth´s tilt</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
